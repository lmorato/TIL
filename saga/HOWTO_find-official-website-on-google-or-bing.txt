# How to search for official website URL on google search and microsoft bing:
25-12-2023

0) METHOD 1 - TYPE THE NAME TWICE:
ex. 1: if you want python's official website, type:
python python

ex. 2: if the term you want is composed of more than one word, type them sepparately:
DO:
casas bahia casas bahia
DON'T:
casasbahia casasbahia

1) METHOD 2 - TYPE WIKIPEDIA + NAME:
Wikipedia normally has official website information on the content box located on the right side of the screen.
Of course, this could be manipulated, but even scammers normally don't think about changing the wikipedia page website info.
This is particularly helpful to search for company software's official websites, specially now that URLs are becoming more and more flexible.

2) CONJECTURE - USING ADDRESS BAR TO SEARCH (INSTEAD OF SEARCH BOX):
# As of now, this is only a conjecture, but it seems searching terms in the address bar (url search box)
# might yield different results than using the "proper" search bar (page's search box).
# Another possibility might be that, after opening a new tab (Ctrl+T),
# the first search is more likely to provide what you want.
